"""Unified on-disk media metadata/artwork/lyrics cache: one human-browsable
folder per movie/series/album (e.g. `movies/Alien (1979)/poster.jpg`), each
with a `metadata.json` tracking where each piece of content came from and
when it was last checked/updated.

Foundation only - not yet wired into the live orchestrator/enrichment
pipeline. Existing `mediainfo.cache.ImageCache` (flat, hash-named artwork
cache), `mediainfo.text_cache.TextCache` (namespaced lyrics/AI-text cache),
`mediainfo.poster_store.PosterStore`, and `mediainfo.artwork_overrides.
ArtworkOverrideStore` are untouched and keep working exactly as before;
nothing here replaces or migrates them yet. `_fetch_*` methods are explicit
stubs (return None) - calling real APIs (TMDB/fanart.tv/MusicBrainz/discogs/
LRCLIB) is separate future work, once this store's cache/refresh mechanics
are proven out.

Directory layout:
    {path}/movies/{Title} ({Year})/poster.jpg
    {path}/movies/{Title} ({Year})/fanart.jpg
    {path}/movies/{Title} ({Year})/metadata.json
    {path}/series/{Title} ({Year})/... (same shape as movies)
    {path}/music/{Artist}/{Album} ({Year})/albumart.jpg
    {path}/music/{Artist}/{Album} ({Year})/fanart.jpg
    {path}/music/{Artist}/{Album} ({Year})/{Track Title}.lrc
    {path}/music/{Artist}/{Album} ({Year})/metadata.json

When year is unknown, the "(Year)" suffix is simply omitted from the
directory name until a later fetch resolves it (see _relocate_to_year_dir).

metadata.json tracks explicit ISO-8601 `last_checked`/`last_updated`
timestamps per artwork/lyrics entry, rather than relying on file mtime like
ImageCache/TextCache do - the point of this store is auditable, inspectable
staleness state, and a file copy/backup bumping mtime shouldn't count as
"we just checked".
